# ILAMB Tutorial/Workshop 

**Global Change Ecology Lab, School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh**
***Tuesday 12th February 2019***

This respository contains the notes and links to the required files for the GCEL ILAMB workshop.

## 0. Overview

ILAMB is a software pacakge for evaluating model outputs angainst observation (benchmark) datasets. It was originially developed by Oak Ridge National Lab in the US and is now an open-source project. We are using it in the MEMBRANE project to evaluate model performance of the Carbon cycle in the Brazilian rainforest/South-America region.

ILAMB was introduced at a previous GCEL meeting, but we will begin with a brief recap and highlight of what it does for a few minutes.

### Paper

The figures in the paper are worh exploring just to get a feel/reminder of ILAMB outputs.

### Project site

https://www.ilamb.org/

Nathan Collier has written a nice overview of ILAMB at the landing page of the project, with links to examples:

(5-10 minutes here just exploring what it can do).

## Setup for hands-on tutorial using ILAMB

### Pre-workshop set up for UoE staff/PGRs

Please complete the instructions below on how to set up your linux environment.

(It is recommended to use the School's Linux infrastructure to run ILAMB, as it is already pre-installed here.)

### Other tutorial followers

Installation of ILAMB is detailed in Tutorial hosted by Oak Ridge National Lab:

## 1. Introductory Tutorial

We will be following the beginners tutorial written by ORNL (Oak Ridge National Lab), who are the original developers. The tutorial pages are here:

https://www.ilamb.org/doc/first_steps.html

## 2. Further features

Time permitting, we will look at some of the other features not covered in the tutorial:

 - NetCDF metadata conventions
 - Masking regions
 - Relationship plots

## 3. Data preparation tips

Having the input data in the correct netCDF format is essential for running ILAMB. The specifications for netCDF input data can seem quite complex at first, so this section will cover how input data should be formatted.
